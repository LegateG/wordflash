# WordFlash ðŸ“–

## Project Overview

WordFlash is a web-based flashcard and quiz application designed to help users efficiently learn new vocabulary. The project is a simple, effective, and user-friendly tool for language acquisition, focusing on core mechanics for learning and testing new words.

### Purpose

Our goal was to create a fun and engaging platform for language learners to build vocabulary. The application allows users to actively learn words through a flashcard-based system and then test their knowledge in a dynamic quiz environment.

### Main Features âœ¨

  - **Personalized Welcome:** Users can enter their name, which is saved locally to provide a personalized experience.
  - **Interactive Flashcards:** The learning section presents words via flashcards that automatically flip or can be manually controlled.
  - **Dynamic Quiz Game:** A multiple-choice quiz tests the user's knowledge of the words learned.
  - **Detailed Quiz Results:** The results screen provides comprehensive feedback, including:
      - Overall score and total time taken.
      - **Average time per question** to help users gauge their pacing.
      - A detailed list of all **incorrectly answered words** for quick review.
  - **Responsive Design:** The application is built with a responsive layout using CSS Flexbox and media queries, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Getting Started

### Installation

This is a web-based application, so no complex installation is required.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LegateG/wordflash
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd WordFlash
    ```
3.  **Run a local web server and open the project:**
    To ensure the JavaScript files work properly when running locally, serve the project using a local web server instead of opening index.html directly.

    Option A. Using Python (if installed):
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    ```
    Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/index.html.

     Option B. Using VS Code Live Server extension (recommended for ease):
   
       - Open the project directory in VS Code.
       - Install the "Live Server" extension if you donâ€™t have it.
       - Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server".
       - This will open the app in your browser with a local server running.
